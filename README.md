AI System for Medical Diagnosis

Objective

The objective of this AI system is to assist in medical diagnosis by improving accuracy and efficiency. It incorporates speech recognition and natural language processing to facilitate interaction.

Dynamic Question Tree

The system uses a dynamic question tree to ask relevant questions based on patient symptoms, prioritizing high-risk symptoms and optimizing the questioning process using Bayesian methods.

Real-time Differential Diagnosis Ranking

It provides a real-time ranked list of possible diagnoses using a probabilistic engine as more information is gathered.

Structured Data Collection

The system emphasizes the importance of collecting data in a structured way for the AI to process effectively.

Reinforcement Learning

The system improves its performance over time through reinforcement learning.

Evidence Linking

It links symptoms to possible diagnoses based on evidence.

Transparency of Model Reasoning

The system provides explanations for its diagnoses, ensuring transparency.

Time-saving and Enhancing Trust

Using the AI system saves time and enhances trust in the diagnostic process.

Clinical Application

The system is designed for use in real clinical settings.
